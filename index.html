<p>
	The goal of the project is to understand how people consume news on social media - and
	help them find content that represents multiple points of view about the issues they care about.
<!-- 	This means, for instance, suggesting links about hillary to trump supporters and vice versa. -->
</p>

<h4>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why it matters</h4>
			<p>
			  We believe that public dialogue and plurality of opinions are necessary
			  for democracies to deal with societal issues -- and the World Wide Web
			  has the potential to facilitate both.
			  Nevertheless, much of the content we consume on the Web today is brought to us by algorithms,
			  which <i>might</i> or <i>might not</i> be tailored to increase our awareness
			  of the different viewpoints around important issues.
			  If not, there is a real possibility that each of us consumes content 
			  that reinforces a specific point of view - perhaps one that we've already
			  subscribed to.
			  Such situations could lead to polarization and estrangement between
			  societal groups that endorse different points of view but have little understanding
			  about the arguments of each other.
			  In this project, our goal is to generate content recommendations that alleviate such
			  situations.
			</p>

			<a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
			How does it work?
			</h3>

			<p>
			We build algorithms to <i>automatically</i> curate and
			recommend content to users who
			are involved in a political discussion on Twitter.
			</p>

			<p>
			We first identify users that were active on the day after the
			latest presidential election (Nov 9, 2016).
			We classify these users into Democrat-leaning or
			Republican-leaning based on their retweet activity,
			using methods from our previous research.
			These methods essentially use the assumption that Democrats
			and Republicans
			predominantly retweet other Democrats and Republicans, 
			respectively.
			</p>

			<p>
			Subsequently, we identify content that is predominantly
			associated with either side - posted by prominent partisan
			accounts like @hillaryclinton and @berniesanders for Democrats
			or @realdonaltrump and @foxnews for Republicans;
			or posted mainly by accounts from one side.
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, we generate article recommendations for each user
				according to the following criteria:
				<ul>
						<li>
				  		how well the topic of the article (represented
				  		with a set of
					  	<a href="http://tagme.d4science.org">TagMe</a>
					  	entities) 
					  	matches the interests of the user, based on past
					  	user activity;
				  	</li>
					<li>
						how likely we think the user is to
						endorse the viewpoint reflected in an
						article, based on the sides associated
						with the user and the article.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Eventually, for each user who participates in the study, 
				we generate two recommended articles that are both close to
				their interests -- one closer to their viewpoint
				than the other.
			</p>

			<h3>What's next?</h3>

			<p>
				We will analyze how users from different sides evaluate
				different recommended articles. Details of our methodology
				will be made available as a pre-print and submitted for 
				peer-review. Aggregate findings will be made available
				on a public webpage.
