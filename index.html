<p>
In this project, we try to connect people with opposing views on Twitter. 
</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is matters</h3>

<p>In the current age of polarisation, it matters to have knowledge of what the other side is talking about.
</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Methodology</h3>

<p>
1. Content shared by the high degree users on the other side — This is the equivalent to the edge with highest reduction in polarity score. In our case, to reduce the polarity score of a user, we just need to connect her to the high degree node on the other side. Number of high degree nodes: 20.
</p>

<p>
2. Content exclusively shared on one side, compared to the other. Shared by only one side: At least 10 users shared it and it is shared at least 3x more times on one side than the other.
</p>

<p>
3. Most retweeted urls with at least 10 retweets each, for each side.
</p>

<p>
4. Topic diversity - We construct a topic vector for a user and content by extracting entities from text (I used tagme.d4science.org). Then we compute cosine distance between user and articles and rank articles by decreasing order of distance.
</p>

<p>
5. Acceptance probability - We compute the acceptance probability between a pair of users, similar to the WSDM'17 paper. Then we compute the acceptance probability of a user and content as the average of acceptance probabilities of the user and all other users (upto 20) who shared this article. We rank articles by acceptance probability for this user.
</p>
