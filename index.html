<p>
	The goal of the project is to understand how people consume news on social media -- and
	help them find content that represents well multiple points of view.
<!-- 	This means, for instance, suggesting links about hillary to trump supporters and vice versa. -->

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why it matters</h3>

<p>In the current age of polarisation, it matters to have knowledge of what the other side is talking about.</p>
<p>We currently live in a polarised society and social media is helping exacerbate these tensions. Our goal is to help users expand their view point, by suggesting what other content exists on the other side. This in turn encourages discussion and ...

			  How does it work?
		  </h3>
		  <p>
			  We built algorithms to curate and recommend content <i>automatically</i> to users who
			  were involved in a political discussion on Twitter.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
			  We first identify users that were active during the election result night (Nov 9, 2016).
			  We classify these users into democrat-leaning or republican-leaning using methods
			  from our previous research.
			  Then, we generate recommendations for each user according to the following two criteria:
			  <list>
				  <li> how likely we think the user might be to endorse the viewpoint;</li>
				  <li> how much we think the viewpoint of the article challenges the viewpoint of the user.</li>
			  </list>
		  </p>
		  
			<h4>How we identify the sides</h4>

				<p>To identify if a user is a democrat or republican, we first compute
					the endorsement network.  We use a simple approach that intuitively works as follows...</p>


			<h4>How we produce the recommendations</h4>
				<p> After identifying the side a user belongs to, we use five factors that for
					computing the recommendations for a user.</p>

				<p>
					1. Content shared by the authoritative high degree users on the other side.
					We first identify authoritative figures on each side e.g. On the democrat side,
					this could be @hillaryclinton, @berniesanders, huffpost, etc and on the republican side,
					this would be @realdonaltrump, @foxnews, etc.
				</p>

				<p>
				2. Acceptance probability - We compute the probability that a user with a certain polarity will endorse a certain url, called the acceptance probability. This is an important factor, because it gives the user a choice. It intuitively measures how 'extreme' the recommendations can be and captures how likely a user is, to like the recommendation. 
				</p>

				<p>
				3. Content exclusively shared on one side, compared to the other. We look for urls shared exclusively on one side and almost none on the other side.
				</p>

				<p>
				4. Most retweeted urls on each side.
				</p>

				<p>
				5. Topic diversity - For each user we try to maximise the information in the content they see. To capture the content already seen by the user, we construct a topic vector for a user by extracting named entities from text (we used <a href="http://tagme.d4science.org" target="_blank">TagMe</a> in this project). Then we compute cosine distance between user and articles and rank articles by decreasing order of distance for every user.
